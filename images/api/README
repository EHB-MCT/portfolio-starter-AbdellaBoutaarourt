# build and run 
docker-compose up --build

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t my-node-app .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app

This will build a Docker image based on the Dockerfile, and then run a container using that image. The container will expose port 3000.

Additional Notes:
Make sure you have a knexfile.js properly configured in your project since it's required for your application to connect to the database.
If you need to connect your application to a database running in another Docker container, you'll need to set up Docker networking or use services in your docker-compose.yml.
